# PyComex â‹… Computational Experiments

The `pycomex` package is a microframework for Python that simplifies the implementation, execution and management of *computational experiments*. The framework defines a natural way of implementing computational experiments in the form of individual Python scripts that automatically manage their own results, metadata, and artifacts.

**ðŸ’¡ Note.** Speaking in terms of other existing technologies, pycomex aims to be an opinionated alternative to [Hydra Configs](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) and a local version of [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/), but with a focus on flexibility and extensibility.

## Installation

### Package Installation

Install the stable version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pycomex
```

### Development Installation

For the latest development version, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the16thpythonist/pycomex.git
cd pycomex
pip install -e .
```

Or using uv (recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the16thpythonist/pycomex.git
cd pycomex
uv pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Core dependencies are automatically installed with the package

## Quickstart

PyComex turns your computational experiments into structured, reproducible, and automatically archived processes. Here's how to get started:

### Basic Experiment Structure

Each experiment is a Python module with uppercase variables as parameters and a main function decorated with `@Experiment()`:

```python
# my_first_experiment.py
"""
This docstring describes what the experiment does and is saved as metadata.
"""

from pycomex.functional.experiment import Experiment
from pycomex.utils import file_namespace, folder_path

# Experiment parameters (uppercase variables are auto-detected)
LEARNING_RATE: float = 0.001
EPOCHS: int = 100
MODEL_NAME: str = "simple_nn"

# Enable debug mode to reuse the same archive folder
__DEBUG__ = True

@Experiment(
    base_path=folder_path(__file__),  # Results stored relative to this file
    namespace=file_namespace(__file__),  # Creates folder based on filename
    glob=globals(),  # Gives access to parameters
)
def experiment(e: Experiment) -> None:
    e.log("Starting training experiment...")

    # Store metadata (creates nested structure in JSON)
    e["config/learning_rate"] = LEARNING_RATE
    e["config/epochs"] = EPOCHS
    e["model/name"] = MODEL_NAME

    # Simulate training loop
    for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
        loss = 1.0 / (epoch + 1)  # Dummy loss that decreases

        # Track metrics over time
        e.track("metrics/loss", loss)
        e.track("metrics/epoch", epoch)

        if epoch % 20 == 0:
            e.log(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss:.4f}")

    # Save final results
    e["results/final_loss"] = loss
    e.commit_raw("training_log.txt", f"Final loss: {loss}")

# Run the experiment when script is executed directly
experiment.run_if_main()
```

### Running Your Experiment

Execute your experiment by running the Python file:

```bash
python my_first_experiment.py
```

### Generated Archive Structure

PyComex automatically creates this organized structure:

```
my_first_experiment/
â””â”€â”€ debug/  # or timestamped folder if __DEBUG__ = False
    â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_meta.json    # Experiment metadata
    â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_data.json    # All tracked data and metrics
    â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_out.log      # Complete execution log
    â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_code.py      # Snapshot of your experiment code
    â”œâ”€â”€ analysis.py            # Ready-to-run analysis code
    â”œâ”€â”€ training_log.txt       # Your committed artifacts
    â””â”€â”€ tracked/               # Auto-generated visualizations
        â””â”€â”€ metrics_loss.png   # Automatic plot of tracked metrics
```

### Command Line Interface

PyComex provides powerful CLI tools:

```bash
# List recent experiments
pycomex archive list

# View basic information about experiment archive
pycomex archive info

# Create new experiment from template
pycomex template experiment my_new_experiment.py
```

### Parameter Overrides

Override parameters from the command line without modifying code:

```bash
python my_first_experiment.py --LEARNING_RATE 0.01 --EPOCHS 50
```

### Key Features in Action

1. **Automatic Archiving**: Every run creates a complete record
2. **Metadata Tracking**: Store structured data with `e["path/key"] = value`
3. **Time Series Tracking**: Use `e.track()` for metrics that change over time
4. **Auto Visualization**: PyComex automatically plots tracked numerical data
5. **Reloadability**: Load any experiment back into memory for analysis
6. **Debug Mode**: Use `__DEBUG__ = True` for iterative development

### Next Steps

- Explore parameter inheritance and experiment composition
- Learn about hooks for custom behavior injection
- Discover advanced archiving and analysis features
- Check out plugin integrations (Weights & Biases, notifications)

This quickstart covers the essentials. PyComex's real power emerges as your experimental needs grow more complexâ€”it scales from simple scripts to sophisticated experimental pipelines while maintaining the same clean, structured approach.
