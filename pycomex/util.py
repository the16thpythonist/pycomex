class RecordCode:

    """
    This class can be used as a context manager to record code.

    **CHANGES 12.09.2022**

    Previously this class worked like this: In the __enter__ method a frameinfo supplied the line number at
    which the context starts and then the same was done in __exit__ and with Python 3.8 this actually worked
    The two methods returned the correct line numbers. But as of Python 3.10, this no longer works because
    the __exit__ method now ALSO returns just the line number of where the context manager starts.

    But since we can still get the start line reliably, we just have to extract the code with some string
    processing now: With the starting line we know the indent of this context manager and can then record
    all the code which follows it in one level of indent deeper.
