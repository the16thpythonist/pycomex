"""
This example showcases the weights and biases integration for pycomex. The weights and biases plugin
is enabled by default and an experiment can be directly logged to the wandb service by meeting the 
following two criteria: 

- The WANDB_API_KEY environment variable is set in the environment from which the experiment was 
  started.
- The experiment defines the WANDB_PROJECT parameter at the beginning of the file as a non-empty 
  string identifier for an exsiting wandb project.
