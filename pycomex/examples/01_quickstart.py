# An experiment is essentially a function. All of the code that constitutes

# The main experiment function has to be decorated with the "Experiment"
# decorator, which needs three main arguments:
# - base_path: The absolute string path to an existing FOLDER, where the
#   archive structure should be created
# - namespace: This is a relative path which defines the concrete folder
#   structure of the specific archive folder for this specific experiment
# - glob: The globals() dictionary for the current file

    # {'strings': {'hello_world': '...'}}
    e["strings/hello_world"] = HELLO + WORLD

    # Alternative to "print". Message is printed to stdout as well as
    # recorded to log file
    e.log("some debug message")

    e.log('analysis done')


# This needs to be put at the end of the experiment. This method will
# then actually execute the main experiment code defined in the function
# above.
# NOTE: The experiment will only be run if this module is directly
# executed (__name__ == '__main__'). Otherwise the experiment will NOT
# be executed, which implies that the experiment module can be imported
# from somewhere else without triggering experiment execution!
