"""
This example illustrates how to use experiment inheritance.

This refers to the concept of defining a "child experiment" which inherits
most of its main functionality from another "parent experiment",
but is able to override the global parameters and inject custom
code using a hook system.

This feature is realized through the "SubExperiment" class which acts the
same as a regular experiment for most cases, but takes another argument
which is the absolute string path to the parent experiment module, which
will then be executed.

# (1) One of the major features of experiment inheritance is the possibility
#     to overwrite the global parameters (upper case variables in global scope)
#     easily.
#     By just assigning new values with the same variable names here, these
#     values will automatically be injected into the runtime of the parent
#     experiment and the experiment will execute with these values instead!
NUM_WORDS = 500

# (2) A sub experiment can be created by using the "extend" class method.
#     The first parameter will have to be either an absolute or a relative
#     path to another, existing, experiment module that will be used as
#     the basis

                               glob=globals())

# (3) Sub experiment implementation rely on so-called hooks. In the base experiment
#     module that is being extended there have to be "apply_hook" statements, which
#     act as entry points where subsequent sub-experiments can inject their own
#     functionality.
#     hooks implementations can be created with just normal functions that are
#     decorated with the "hook" method of the experiment and the string name
#     given to that decorator defines the hook to be implemented.

# NOTE: The first argument of every hook function is always the experiment instance e
#       of the parent experiment!
#       after that, the names of additional parameters, if there are any at all, depend
#       on how the individual hooks were set up in the parent experiment.

    remove_indices = random.sample(indices, k=10)
    for index in remove_indices:
        words.pop(index)

    # Since the name indicates that this is a filter hook, we need to return the new
    # value of the words variable.
    return words


@experiment.hook('after_experiment')
def after_experiment(e):
    e.log('We can even use the logging here!')

    # We can simply access all the parameters which have been defined in either
    # beginnings of the experiment modules simply through the main experiment
    # instance "e"
    e.log(f'Number of repetitions done: {e.REPETITIONS}')

    # And we can assign / modify the contents of the experiment data store
    e['message'] = 'hello from sub experiment!'


# (4) Analysis extensions:
#     We can even define an analysis section for sub experiments as well. These are additive,
#     which means that the analysis of a sub experiment is run after the analysis of the
#     parent experiment and that is even the case for the code that is copied to the analysis.py
#     file! The code which is copied there is a concatenation of all the individual analysis
#     code snippets in the order in which they are executed.
@experiment.analysis
def analysis(e):
    # We can also add additional analysis in the sub experiments!
    e.log('hello from sub experiment analysis!')
