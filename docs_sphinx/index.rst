Python Computational Experiments
=================================

Python Computational Experiments (*pycomex*) is a microframework to improve the experience of conducting and
managing the records of computational experiments in Python.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Automatic folder / record creation for each new run of an experiment
- Easily attach file artifacts, such as csv, json or matplotlib figures, to the experiment records
- Record simple metadata, such as metrics, into a central associative storage, which is automatically
  exported as a json file at the end of the experiment
